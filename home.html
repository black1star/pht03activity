                        After his law firm discovered that Jeff's bachelor's degree was falsified, Jeff was disbarred. 
                        He enrolled at Greendale Community College to earn a legitimate degree. 
                        He hoped to exploit his friendship with a professor who worked there, Ian Duncan, 
                        in order to secure an easy graduation. Another student named Britta Perry caught his eye 
                        and he pretended to be the head of a Spanish study group to impress her. Unexpectedly, 
                        a real study group is formed with other members of his class thanks to Abed Nadir. 
                        Jeff became the reluctant leader of the group and together they dealt with the unusual college life at Greendale.

                        Although Jeff is revealed to be a fraud and kicked out of the study session, Britta and 
                        the study group take pity on him and allow him to return. 
                        She initially attempts to keep everyone in the group in line, especially Jeff, 
                        but by the end off the year abandons her role as the voice of reason.

                        It is hinted that Abed is autistic, reflected in his inability to pick up on social or emotional cues ("Pilot"). 
                        Abed is quite intelligent, fluent in three languages (English, Polish and Arabic) and possesses 
                        keen observational skills. He often accurately predicts other people's behaviors ("Debate 109") 
                        although it's shown he is not infallible ("Virtual Systems Analysis"). He'll draw connections to real life 
                        situations through pop culture and meta references gained after years of watching TV and movies ("Pilot"). 
                        However, he has problems understanding emotions and has a particular difficulty with grasping sarcasm.

                        While she is proud to be an African American woman and a mother, she tries not to be defined 
                        by just those characteristics. Her age is something she is very sensitive about, as she is one 
                        of the older study group members and often tries to prove to them that she is still relevant 
                        ("The Science of Illusion"). She often notes despite this perpection she and Jeff are very close in age. 
                        She becomes the "mother hen" of the group often offering unwanted advice or opinions to the other members 
                        ("Comparative Religion").
